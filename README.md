# credit-risk-classification

Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict credit risk based on borrower financial data.
Using logistic regression, the model classifies loans as either "healthy" or "high-risk" based on features such as loan size, interest rate, income, and debt-to-income ratio.

Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

Files
- credit_risk_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full data processing, model training, and evaluation workflow.
- lending_data.csv: Dataset used for model training and testing.
- README.md: Repository overview (this file).
- report-template.md: Credit risk analysis report.

Usage
Clone the repository, open the Jupyter Notebook (credit_risk_classification.ipynb), and run the cells sequentially to recreate the analysis and model training process.
